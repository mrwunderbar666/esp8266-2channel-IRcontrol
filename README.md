# Just another ESP8266 Airconditioning Control
## Dual Channel Infrared Control with Webinterface & MQTT

*This is a self-study project, it is far from perfect or optimal. It is working fine for me. I share the code, because maybe someone can learn from it or reuse it.*

- Build in Arduino IDE
- Has two separate Infrared Channels
- Features a Webinterface to control (mobile friendly)
- MQTT Support
- Data Streaming in JSON Format
- With BME280 Temperature, Humidity and Pressure Sensor (publishes data via MQTT and on Webinterface)
